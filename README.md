# SVZreprogramming

Code to analyze single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data and generate figures for:
Xu L, Ramirez-Matias J, Hauptschein M, Sun ED, Lunger JC, Buckley MT, Brunet A. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals restoration of neuronal progenitors in the old neurogenic niche by partial reprogramming.

Raw sequencing reads and processed files for single-cell RNA-seq experiments are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE224438. 

Processed Seurat objects for single-cell RNA-seq are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10626910. 

Raw sequencing reads, count files, and normalized count files for bulk RNA-seq are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE245385.
