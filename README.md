# SVZreprogramming

Code to analyze single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data and generate figures for:
Xu L, Ramirez-Matias J, Hauptschein M, Sun ED, Lunger JC, Buckley MT, Brunet A. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals restoration of neuronal progenitors in the old neurogenic niche by partial reprogramming.

Raw sequencing reads and processed files for single-cell RNA-seq experiments are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE224438. Seurat objects for each experiment are included here in the corresponding folder. 

Raw sequencing reads, count files, and normalized count files for bulk RNA-seq are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE245385.
